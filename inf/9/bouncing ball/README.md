# Bouncing Balls

This is an example toy application, built iteratively,
that will bounce many balls on the screen.

We are iteratively adding features as we agree. Possible
features:
  - collision detection (balls bounce off each other, not just
    the edges)
  - gravitation (balls attracting each other according to their
    "mass")
  - ball hunting, i.e. click on ball to delete it
  - ...?
